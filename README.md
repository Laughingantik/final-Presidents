> 14.1 President Programming Scenario

> Page: Out of book

> Files you will be submitting: bag.h, bag.cpp, president.h, president.cpp and testPresidents.cpp

> Notes: Zip your project folder and submit the zip file.

> Points: 60

> Data files are listed in FAQ number 2 below the programming scenario along with other final FAQs.

> Your company has been asked to develop a program for the Brain Readiness Academic Training Institute (BRATI) that will help their BRATI elementary students learn the order of United States Presidents as well as some information about them. Write a C++ console application that performs the tasks as spelled out below:

> In this project, you will implement a bag class that will store a vector of presidents. The Program will display a president name and then ask you what the presidential number is. For example, "What is the presidential number of Barack Obama?". Your reply should be 44. At that point in time the program will display:

> Time he lived

> date he took office

> date he left office

> his party

> previous office held

> the name of his vice president

> If you type an incorrect value for the presidential number, the program will display an error message and the correct presidential number, incorrect responses and total guesses.

> The User will click -1 to exit the program if they do not want to continue guessing presidential numbers.

> Your program should use ASCII colors to set background and foreground (font) colors to reflect correct and incorrect responses. See FAQ #8 for details.

> You will need to create a first screen that gives users/players directions. Here is one possibility:

> Presidents' Game

> Guess the number of each President

> or key in -1 for guess to exit
